	* gps4.f: P1C1 DCB files used for the lack of P1.  Modified some
	output syntax for not confusing with free style Fortran code.
	Rewrote some remarks in gps4.f for easy reading.
	* gps4inc.f: Renamed gps4.par to gps4inc.f for color syntax in vi
	editor.
	* DCB/: Moved all of the DCB files to the DCB directory.
	* README: Update.
2007-12-14
	* ChangeLog: Created ChangeLog file.
	* README: Moved the update message to ChangeLog.
2006-04-14
	* gps4.f: Corrected the output format of slant TEC value to (1x,f6.2).
2005-10-04
	* gps4.f: Data types other than P1, P2, L1, L2, C1 at column 5 of the
	O-file ignored.
2005-07-26
	* marker.crd: Updated the coordinates.  Notice that there are two
	markers named "sunm" at Taiwan and Australia, respectively.  Only the
	one at Taiwan is recorded in the file.
2005-07-13
	* gps4.f: Compatible with the navigation data in RINEX version 1.
2005-06-27
	* gps4.f: Initialized variables K and SUM with 0 in subroutine MINTEC.
2005-06-17
	* gps4.f: Initialized variable DOY with 0 in subroutine OBSDATE.
2004-08-13
	* gps4.f: Compatible with the observation files where the statement
	"END OF HEADER" is missing.

2004-07-26
	* gps4.f: More description added.  Day of year is used instead of the
	Julian date.
2003-10-14
	* gps4.f: Read GPS DCB but discarded GLONASS DCB.
2003-07-27
	* gps4.f: Read GPS observation data but discarded GLONASS data
	provided by Ashtech Z18 and other GLONASS-compatible receivers.
2002-03-27
	* gps4.f: Compatible with the navigation files where the statement
	"END OF HEADER" is missing.
2002-01-17
	* gps4.f: Read BRDC files instead of the associated broadcast ephemeris
	file if available.
2001-08-28
	* gps4.f: Use parameterization as input.

Version 4.0
2001-03-02
	* gps4.f: Major revision on solutions of ambiguities, cycle slips,
	extraordinary time resolution, and satellite differential bias, etc.
	Change the definition of DCB as P1-P2 according to CODE, instead of
	the previous definition, P2-P1.

Version 3.6
2001-02-22
	* gps36.f: Modified subroutine AMBIGUITY to solve severe cycle slips
	and to improve the quality of TEC estimates.

Version 3.5
2001-02-21
	* gps35.f: Renewed Subroutine AMBIGUITY with a better detecting and
	offsetting method.  Data overflow in slant TEC output fixed.  Two
	satellite biases in SATBIAS added.

Version 3.4
2000-11-09
	* gps34.f: Ignored extra types of observation (e.g. D1, S2) in the
	RINEX format data.  A bug on the slant TEC output fixed.

Version 3.3
	* gps33.f: A bug in subroutine MINTEC fixed.

Version 3.2
	* gps32.f: Read C1 instead of P1 for the lack of P1.  Y2K problem
	fixed.

Version 3.1
	* gps31.f: Some logical problems in subroutine HEADER fixed.
	* MARKPOS.DAT: Created coordinate file MARKPOS.DAT, which is read
	instead of the approximate coordinate in the observation file.
	* gps31.f: Check the date consistency between file name and its
	content.  Abort when inconsistent.  More description added.  Ignored
	wrong TEC values caused by P1=P2 while S/N < 3 in L1 or L2.
